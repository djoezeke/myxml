# [MYXML](https://djoezeke.github.io/myxml) [ EXAMPLES ]

This folder contains code examples for the C and C++ APIs.

> [!NOTE]
> Myxml is still in development.

The purpose of Examples is to showcase integration, let you try Myxml, and guide you toward
integrating Myxml in your own application.

## Getting Started

Integration in a typical existing application, should take no time.

```cpp
#include <myxml/myxml>
```

Main resource:

- Read **[Documentation](https://djoezeke.github.io/myxml/)** for detailed on how to integrate Myxml.

<!-- ## Building the Examples

The examples assume you have already built the `myjson` library in `../src`.

### With Make

```bash
make # builds all api examples and tests.
make examples  # builds all examples.
make examples/loading # builds one examples (e.g `make examples/loading`
```

### With CMake

To build the examples with cmake, run the following commands from the root of the repository:

```bash
cd examples/c
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

This will produce binaries for each example: one that links with a shared Myxml library, and one that is linked with static Myxml library. The binaries linked with the static library have the postfix **\_s**.

To run a single example, execute it from the `build` directory:

```bash
./loading
```

## API EXAMPLES COLLECTION [TOTAL: 1]

Examples showing myjson functionality, like standalone usage or examples integrating external libraries.
